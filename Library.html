    <h2> Library  teachers work </h2>
      <p>Handle the Hole library engaging the chilldren to tead the books and do some science experiment , drawing activities etc.....</p>
			<br><p>School librarians may read to children, assist them in selecting books, assist with schoolwork and also guiding them on which books to use for their projects especially the secondary school ones. Some school librarians see classes on a "flexible schedule". A flexible schedule means that rather than having students come to the library for instruction at a fixed time every week, the classroom teacher schedules library time when the expertise of the school librarian, library and information skills, or materials are needed as part of a learning experience.</p>
			<br><p>In the instructional partner role, school librarians collaborate with classroom teachers to create independent learners by fostering students' research, information literacy, technology, communication, and critical thinking skills. School librarians play a major role in infusing Information Literacy concepts and skills into secondary school curricula as well as enhances implementation of Information Literacy knowledge practices and dispositions into the secondary school education system.</p>
			<br><p>As information specialists, school librarians develop a resource base for the school by using the curriculum and student interests to identify and obtain library materials. They also organize and maintain the library collection in order to promote independent reading and lifelong learning. Materials in the library collection can be located using an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC).</p>
			<br><p>This role also encompasses many activities relating to technology including the integration of resources in a variety of formats: periodical databases; Web sites; digital video segments; podcasts; blog and wiki content; digital images; virtual classrooms, etc. School librarians are often responsible for audio-visual equipment and other technology used in the classroom. In some schools, they are also tasked as the technology specialist.</p>
			<br><p>As program administrators, school librarians define, lead, and manage school library media programs by establishing library policies; overseeing the library budget; planning the physical and virtual library space; and maintaining a welcoming, positive, and innovative learning atmosphere. Librarians also maintain the collection by adding items to enhance curriculum and entice readers in order to have good relationships with the patrons, both teachers and students. Many times, librarians are also responsible for repairing damaged books and periodicals.</p>
